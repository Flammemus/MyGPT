MyGPT is a python program where you can chat with ChatGPT and view previous chat log as you see fit.
With my program you can freely change the personality of ChatGPT.

Under, I have written a guide on how to run the program through an IDE and through your terminal.

To run the program through an IDE, you would need to create a file named "myApiKey.json" inside the /MyGPT/ folder.
Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and create a new personal API key.
Open your myApiKey.json file and type "{myApiKey: "insertYourApiKeyHere"}". (example: {myApiKey: "sk-gfhdfsd7fG6h56dfDgspdfs786"}

To run the program through your terminal, be sure to have python3 installed.
Maneuver yourself to the MyGPT directory and type "touch myApiKey.json" to create the necessary file.
Type "nano myApiKey.json" and write "{myApiKey: "insertYourApiKeyHere"}". (example: {myApiKey: "sk-gfhdfsd7fG6h56dfDgspdfs786"}
Find the mainFolder in the MyGPT directory and run the main.py file with "python3 main.py".
Download any needed packages with pip install "packageName".
Run the file again to repeat the last step until all packages have been donwloaded.
